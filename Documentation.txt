My Company Hierarchy project basically consists of 3 files:

Employee.cs - base Employee class which holds the properties of the employee and a pointer
for the next employee

ListOfEmployees.cs - class which holds the helper properties and methods for the LinkedList
implementation

HrManager.cs - the main program in which I have created a LinkedList instance,
added Employee objects to it, performed different actions on them.

Additional info can be found in the comments directly in the source code.
